# Pype

Pype is a secure P2P shared file storage solution.
When you use Pype, you need to be able to give in order to get.

Pype works on the premise that the more people use it, the better it is.
If more people use Pype, it would be:
- Easier to find peers.
- Peers would have better connection with you.
- Your files will be more secured.
- Your files won't get lost.
- Would make me happy :)

Pype was originated from my finals project at CS & Cyber class and its main goal was to achieve P2P communication between multiple devices.

## Explanation
When you upload a file using Pype:
- The file gets disassembled into smaller pieces.
- Each piece gets stored at a different peer.
- You get a .pype file with information on the locaiton of every piece of your file.
